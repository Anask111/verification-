1.Introduction 

 2.Describe the projects you have worked on so far?

3.Develop a SystemVerilog model for a digitally controlled buck regulator with Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) functionality?

4.How would you describe the simulation and verification environment used for the buck regulator project?

5.What types of bugs or issues did you encounter during the verification of the buck regulator, and how did you resolve them?

6.Explain the logic behind how the buck regulator steps down the voltage.

7.What is the difference between SVRNM (SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling), wreal, and electrical modeling in AMS simulations?

8.Which analog solver is triggered when using wreal modeling in AMS simulations?

9.Can you write a wreal model for a 1 MHz oscillator?

10.What is the purpose of a connectmodule in mixed-signal modeling?

11.What is the internal logic or functionality typically implemented inside a connectmodule?

12.Can you write a comparator model using electrical modeling in Verilog-AMS?

13.If you are assigned an analog/mixed-signal block to model and verify independently, would you be able to take full ownership and drive it to completion?
