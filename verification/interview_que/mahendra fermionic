Fermionic - AMS Verification Interview

1) Introduction
2) Asked to explain in detail about the Flash ADC project I did.
3) Write SV-RNM model for Comparator
4) Draw the SV TB architecture
5) A pulse is givren to a RC low-pass. Draw the output.
6) An output wreal wire is getting driven by many internal blocks, what will be the output? (use of resolution fucntion)
7) Difference between case, casex, casez.
8) Difference between == and ===.
9) What are config files. Is config file always required for running wreal simualtions?
10) Suppose I want to run a wreal model in an analog-on-top schematic TB, how to do it.
