Didn’t ask what u did , directly started topics  : Started with anallog, then electrical modeling, then saw resume then asked LDO as given in resume.
1.	.diffferent combnination of rc circuit & to find output voltage
2.	 to find transfer function of given rc circuit 
3.	Mosfet id equation linear & saturation
4.	Id vs vgs , id vs vds curve
5.	Id vs vgs and to show all regions of mosfert in that
6.	 and to find its poles & zeros using that.
7.	 electrical modelling based question
8.	 contribution operator, & asked how it works
9.	gave waverform digital & asked which operator is used to convert given waveform to different required waveform with ramp & delay  = transition operator
10.	 To code R L C in electrical modelling
11.	 MVS in detail, 
12.	 how u gave input stimuls to variable is MVS
13.	 do u know config file in MVS  ( not config view)
14.	 RNM / sv rnm based question (code)
15.	4:1 mux RNM code
16.	Files in MVS
17.	 Connect module, amsd block 
18.	 checkers to write in RNM to restrict variable values whwithin range
19.	  do that other than ternery operator
20.	Gave code for amplifer gain and ask to use that model’s parameter in new module & make their instances and how to change those parameters value if needed.
