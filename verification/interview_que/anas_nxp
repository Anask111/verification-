intro of yourself .
1.	.diffferent combnination of rc circuit & to find output voltage
2.	 to find transfer function of given rc circuit 
3.	Mosfet id equation linear & saturation
4.	Id vs vgs , id vs vds curve
5.	Id vs vgs and to show all regions of mosfert in that
6.	 and to find its poles & zeros using that.
7.	 electrical modelling based question
8.	 contribution operator, & asked how it works
9.	gave waverform digital & asked which operator is used to convert given waveform to different required waveform with ramp & delay  = transition operator
10.	 To code R L C in electrical modelling
11.	 MVS in detail, 
12.	 how u gave input stimuls to variable is MVS
14.	 RNM / sv rnm based question (code)
15.	Files in MVS
16.	 Connect module, amsd block 
17.	 checkers to write in RNM to restrict variable values whwithin range
18.	  do that other than ternery operator
19.	Gave code for amplifer gain and ask to use that modelâ€™s parameter in new module & make their instances and how to change those parameters value if needed.
20.	Current mirror code of given circuit
21.	Rlc circuit electrical modling code
22.	Connect module 
make and gate with mosfet
